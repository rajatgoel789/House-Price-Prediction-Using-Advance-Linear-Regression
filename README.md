## General Information
- This assignment is a part of the course and the author is pursuing at UpGrad in collaboration with IIIT (Banglore)
- In this assignment, we will use EDA to understand how attributes influence the Price of houses .
- Our aim will be to find correlations between these featurs and come up with a advanced regression model that can predict the Sale Price of houses in Australia.

## Conclusions
- The Living area of the house is a major infuencer for the price.
- The Overall Condition of the house on sale also has a good impact on the sale price
- First Floor Square feet also has a significant impact on the price of the house 
- Finally the Age of the house also drops the value of the house .

## Technologies Used
